I'm sitting here at my desk—the same spot where I spend my days working in tech—staring at my banking app. Usually, I'm focused on code or project deadlines. Today, I'm trying to debug my own finances.

## Your 15-Minute "Debt Debugging" Audit

If you're overwhelmed, try this simple financial audit:

1. **Subscription Scan:** Open your phone's settings and cancel one thing you didn't use in December.

2. **High-Interest Highlight:** Identify the card with the highest APR. Even small reductions here make a big difference.

3. **Joy Review:** Find one purchase that brought real, lasting joy. Money aligned with values isn't wasted.
