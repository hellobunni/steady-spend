# Finding the “Zombies” in My Bank Account: My First Subscription Audit 🧟‍♀️

Let’s be real: the beginning of the year usually comes with a bit of a **financial hangover**.

After the holiday blur of gifts, travel, and those "this will make my life easier" impulse buys, I finally sat down to open my bank statement. I was nervous. As a software engineer, my life is built on tools and apps. I’m a sucker for a "Start Free Trial" button, and somewhere along the way, I became a **passive payer**.

I wasn't being reckless; I was just busy. So, instead of beating myself up, I decided to get curious. I went on a hunt for the "Zombies."

---

## What Exactly Are "Zombie" Costs?

Zombie costs are those recurring payments for things you:

- Forgot to cancel after a 7-day trial.
- Signed up for during a "future-me" productivity spurt.
- Don't even use anymore but keep paying for because "it's only $10."

For me, the culprits were a [Monarch Money](https://www.monarchmoney.com/) account I wasn't checking, a couple of dating apps I thought I'd deleted, and a [CapCut](https://www.capcut.com/) subscription from a one-off video project.

### The "10-Year Leak"

The math is what really stung. A "small" $15/month subscription is **$1,800 over a decade**. When I compared that to my actual earnings using this [Take-Home Pay Calculator](http://localhost:3000/tools/take-home-pay-calculator), it didn't feel like a small charge anymore. It felt like a leak in my boat.

## My 3-Step "Zombie Hunt"

If you want to clear the deck, checking your primary bank app isn't enough. You have to look in the shadows.

### 1. The Inbox Deep-Dive

Search your email for keywords like **"trial," "receipt," "invoice,"** or **"subscription."** I found three trials that were about to convert to paid plans just by doing this.

> **Pro Tip:** Use a tool like [Unroll.me](https://unroll.me/) to see a list of every newsletter and service hitting your inbox.

### 2. The Smartphone Audit

Many charges hide under generic names like "Apple" or "Google."

- **On iPhone:** Go to Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions.
- **On Android:** Open the Play Store > Profile Icon > Payments & Subscriptions.
  I found a meditation app here that I hadn't opened since 2024.

### 3. The "Ghost" Card Check

Check those credit cards you rarely use. Because they aren't part of your daily "mental math," they are the perfect hiding spot for annual fees.

## Should You Keep It or Kill It?

To make it easy, I used a simple "Value Framework" to decide what stayed:

![Value Framework: Decision guide for keeping or canceling subscriptions](https://res.cloudinary.com/bytebeardigital/image/upload/v1767501491/SteadySpend/Posts/Zombie-Posts/gut-check-transparent_wcxhb7.png)

**Want a template to track your audit?** I created a [Subscription Audit Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ejX7WirabGe_bpQyzRrlyCkPh6bg_iBx/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116487667966000157183&rtpof=true&sd=true) you can copy, or [download the Excel version](https://res.cloudinary.com/bytebeardigital/raw/upload/v1767501681/SteadySpend/Posts/Zombie-Posts/Subscription_Audit_Template_SteadySpend_ufq9sl.xlsx) to use offline.

Once you've cleared the dead weight, try plugging your new numbers into a [50/30/20 Budget Calculator](http://localhost:3000/tools/50-30-20) to see how much faster you can hit your actual goals.

## Why Is Canceling So Hard?

If you feel frustrated, it's not you—it's [Dark Patterns](https://www.deceptive.design/). Many companies intentionally hide the cancel button or force you into a live chat just to stop a $5 charge. Don't let the friction win.

### Tools to Help You Clean Up

- **[Subscription Audit Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ejX7WirabGe_bpQyzRrlyCkPh6bg_iBx/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116487667966000157183&rtpof=true&sd=true):** Track your subscriptions, costs, and decisions using the "Gut Check" framework. [Download the Excel version](https://res.cloudinary.com/bytebeardigital/raw/upload/v1767501681/SteadySpend/Posts/Zombie-Posts/Subscription_Audit_Template_SteadySpend_ufq9sl.xlsx) if you prefer.
- **[SteadySpend Monthly Budget Calculator](http://localhost:3000/tools/monthly-budget):** To see the big picture of your spending.
- **[Monarch Money](https://www.monarchmoney.com/):** To sync all your accounts and spot recurring charges in one place.
- **[Rocket Money](https://www.rocketmoney.com/):** A great external alternative specifically for identifying and canceling subscriptions.

## The Bottom Line

This isn't about being perfect or living a "no-fun" life. It’s about **technical debt for your wallet**. Just like cleaning up unused code, cleaning up your subscriptions makes the whole system run smoother.

Even if you only find _one_ $10 zombie today, that’s $120 back in your pocket this year. 🥂
