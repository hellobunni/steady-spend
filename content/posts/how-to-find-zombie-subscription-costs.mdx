# Finding the “Zombies” in My Bank Account: My First Subscription Audit 🧟‍♀️

## Why I Finally Looked at My Bank Statement

If you’re anything like me, the beginning of the year comes with a bit of a **financial hangover**.

After the holidays — gifts, travel, and a few too many _“this will definitely make my life easier”_ purchases — I finally sat down and opened my bank statement. I’ll be honest: I was nervous.

As a software engineer, I live in a world of tools, apps, and subscriptions. I’m constantly testing products, signing up for trials, or convincing myself that _this one_ will finally organize my life.

Somewhere along the way, I became what I now think of as a **passive payer**.

Not reckless.  
Not irresponsible.  
Just busy, curious, and very good at clicking **Start Free Trial**.

So instead of judging myself, I decided to get curious.

That curiosity turned into my first **subscription audit**. It also made me realize that before changing anything, I needed a clearer picture of my baseline spending — which is why tools like my [Monthly Budget Calculator](/tools/monthly-budget) came in handy later.

> **Quick Answer:**  
> Zombie subscription costs are recurring charges for apps or services you no longer use, forgot to cancel, or didn't realize were still active. A subscription audit helps you find these charges by checking your email, phone subscriptions, and inactive cards — often uncovering hundreds of dollars a year in wasted spending.

## What Are "Zombie" Subscription Costs?

Before I even started, I needed a name for what I was looking for.

I started calling them **Zombie Costs**.

These are recurring payments for services you:

- No longer use
- Meant to cancel after a trial
- Signed up for during a _“future-me will absolutely use this”_ moment

They quietly show up month after month, usually in small amounts that feel easy to ignore — but over time, they slowly eat away at your budget.

For me, this looked like:

- **Monarch Money** — a tool I genuinely like, but wasn’t checking consistently
- A couple of **dating apps** I _swore_ I canceled after one slow month
- A **CapCut yearly subscription** I bought during a creative burst… and then forgot to use

None of these were bad decisions on their own. They just stuck around longer than their usefulness.

## How Much Do Small Subscriptions Really Cost Over Time?

This is the moment that changed everything for me.

I used to think:

> “It’s just $10 or $15 — not a big deal.”

But seeing the long-term math reframed it completely.

> 💰 **The 10-Year Leak**
>
> That $15/month subscription isn’t just $180 a year —  
> it’s **$1,800 over a decade**.
>
> When I looked at this alongside my actual take-home pay using the  
> [Take-Home Pay Calculator](/tools/take-home-pay-calculator),  
> canceling suddenly felt like reclaiming real money — not giving something up.

Suddenly, that forgotten CapCut subscription didn’t feel “small.”  
It felt like money I could redirect toward things I actually care about.

Canceling stopped feeling restrictive.  
It felt empowering.

## How to Find Hidden Subscriptions (My 3-Step Search)

I learned quickly that checking my main bank app wasn't enough. Subscriptions are sneaky — and they hide in layers.

Here's the simple process I followed:

1. Search my inbox for trials and receipts
2. Check phone-based subscriptions (Apple / Google)
3. Review inactive or rarely used credit cards

Here's exactly where I found mine.

---

### How to Find Subscription Trials in Your Email Inbox

I opened my email and searched for keywords like:

- **Trial**
- **Subscription**
- **Receipt**
- **Invoice**

This is where I found some of my most embarrassing zombies — including tools I vaguely remembered being excited about… and never opened again.

That search alone uncovered **three “free” trials** I had started during the holidays, all just days away from converting into paid plans.

> 📧 **Tip:**  
> If you only do one thing today, try this inbox search.  
> It’s fast and surprisingly revealing.

---

### How to Find Subscriptions in Your Phone Settings

Some subscriptions don’t show up clearly on your bank statement. Instead, they appear as generic charges like **Apple** or **Google**.

When I checked my phone’s **Subscriptions** section, I found:

- A meditation app I deleted months ago
- A dating app I _thought_ I canceled 😅

Out of sight really does mean out of mind.

---

### How to Find Subscriptions on Inactive Credit Cards

This one stung a little.

I have one credit card I rarely use — mostly for online tools and random purchases. When I logged in, I found an **annual charge** I hadn’t mentally accounted for at all.

Because I don’t check that card often, it was the perfect hiding spot for a zombie cost.

---

## What Surprised Me During My First Subscription Audit

This wasn’t about guilt. It was about awareness.

Here were my biggest “ouch” moments:

- **The Double-Up:** Paying for multiple apps that did basically the same thing
- **The “I’ll Get Back to This”:** A yearly subscription I bought with good intentions… and never reopened
- **The Annual Surprise:** A once-a-year charge that felt invisible until it hit

None of these made me irresponsible — they made me human.  
And honestly? Very on-brand for a curious nerd.

## How I Decided What to Keep vs. Cancel

To avoid overwhelm, I asked myself one simple question:

> _Is this still adding value to my life today?_

Here's how I mentally sorted each subscription:

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Reflection", "What It Meant"]}
  rows={[
    [
      '<strong>"Hell Yes"</strong>',
      "I use this regularly and it genuinely improves my life",
    ],
    [
      '<strong>"Maybe?"</strong>',
      "I haven't used it lately, but I keep thinking I might",
    ],
    ['<strong>"Who?"</strong>', "I don't even remember what this company does"],
  ]}
/>

Anything in the **“Who?”** category was an easy cancel.

For the rest, I thought about how they fit into my overall spending balance. Framing them inside something like the [50/30/20 budget framework](/tools/50-30-20) helped me decide which ones actually deserved space in my “wants.”

## Why Canceling Subscriptions Can Feel So Hard

One thing I didn’t expect was how much friction some companies create around canceling.

In the tech world, these are called **dark patterns** — design choices meant to delay, confuse, or discourage you from leaving.

I ran into:

- Hidden cancel buttons
- Multiple confirmation screens
- A live chat requirement to cancel a **$4/month** service 😐

If canceling feels harder than signing up, that’s not a personal failure — it’s intentional design.

---

## Why Awareness Matters More Than Perfection

My goal wasn’t to cancel everything.

It was simply to **see clearly**.

Just knowing where my money was going — even before canceling anything — gave me a sense of relief and control I hadn’t felt in a while.

If you’re overwhelmed, here’s your permission slip:

- You don’t need to fix everything today
- You don’t need to feel guilty
- You just need to look

That alone is progress.

You don't have to do this perfectly.  
Even finding **one zombie** is a win. 💕

## A Nerdy Way to Think About Zombie Subscriptions

As a software engineer, I started thinking about zombie subscriptions the same way I think about unused code.

If something is still running in production but no longer serving users, it's technical debt.

Zombie subscriptions are kind of the same thing — money running in the background without delivering value.

Doing a subscription audit didn't mean deleting everything.  
It just meant cleaning up what no longer belonged.

## Tools That Helped Me Most

Here’s what helped me during my audit — use one or all of these, at your own pace:

- 🧾 **Subscription Audit Spreadsheet**  
  Track services, costs, renewal dates, and cancellation status.

- 📊 **Budget Context Tools**  
  Pair your audit with the  
  [Monthly Budget Calculator](/tools/monthly-budget) or  
  [50/30/20 Calculator](/tools/50-30-20)  
  to see where that freed-up money can actually go.

- 💸 **Monarch Money**  
  I’ve used [Monarch Money](https://www.monarchmoney.com) to get a cleaner, higher-level view of my accounts and recurring charges — especially helpful when I want everything in one place instead of hopping between apps.

- 📧 **Inbox Search Prompts**  
  Keywords like _trial_, _receipt_, _invoice_, and _subscription_ to surface forgotten sign-ups.
