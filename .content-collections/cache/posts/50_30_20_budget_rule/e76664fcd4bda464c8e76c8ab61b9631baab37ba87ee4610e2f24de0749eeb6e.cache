Saving 5% is infinitely better than saving 0%. The goal is to build the habit of paying yourself first. As your income grows or expenses decrease, gradually increase your savings percentage. In 2025, many people find starting with 10-15% more realistic than jumping straight to 20%.\"},{question:'Does debt repayment count as \"Needs\" or \"Savings\"?',answer:\"Minimum payments are Needs, but any extra payments to crush your balance faster fall into the 20% Savings/Debt category. This includes paying down credit cards, student loans, or other high-interest debt beyond the minimum required payment.\"},{question:\"How do I handle subscription services in the 50/30/20 rule?\",answer:\"Subscription services typically fall into the 30% Wants category. However, if you have many subscriptions (streaming, apps, memberships), they can quickly consume a large portion of this category. Consider auditing your subscriptions quarterly and canceling what you don't use. Many people in 2025 are finding they can save hundreds per year by cutting unused services.\"},{question:\"Is the 50/30/20 rule still relevant with current inflation?\",answer:\"The framework remains valuable, but the percentages may need adjustment. If inflation has pushed your essential costs above 50%, use a variation like 60/20/20 or 55/25/20. The key principle\\u2014separating needs, wants, and savings\\u2014is still sound, even if the exact percentages need to reflect current economic reality.\"},{question:\"Should I prioritize emergency savings or retirement in the 20% category?\",answer:\"Build your emergency fund first (aim for 3-6 months of expenses), then shift focus to retirement savings. If you're starting from zero, you might temporarily allocate most of your 20% to emergency savings until you hit that target, then split between emergency fund maintenance and retirement contributions.\"}]})]})}function u(t={}){let{wrapper:e}=t.components||{};return e?(0,n.jsx)(e,{...t,children:(0,n.jsx)(h,{...t})}):h(t)}function d(t,e){throw new Error(\"Expected \"+(e?\"component\":\"object\")+\" `\"+t+\"` to be defined: you likely forgot to import, pass, or provide it.\")}return k(x);})();\n;return Component;"
