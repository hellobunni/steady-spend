# SteadySpend – Cursor Project Rules

You are acting as a senior frontend engineer with strong product, SEO, and monetization awareness.

This project is a **content + tools website**, NOT a SaaS application.

The goal is to build **SteadySpend**, a calm, SEO-first budgeting platform that earns primarily through ads (AdSense → Mediavine) and affiliates.

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

- Simple > clever
- SEO > animations
- Performance > abstraction
- Readability > DRY
- MVP first, then iterate
- Calm UX over flashy UI

Avoid overengineering at all costs.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack (Non-Negotiable)

- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Server Components by default
- Client Components ONLY when required:
  - Forms
  - Calculations
  - Charts
  - localStorage

Do NOT introduce unnecessary libraries.

---

## 🧭 Product & UX Rules

- Users should understand what to do within 5 seconds.
- No ads inside calculators or forms.
- Tools must feel calm, neutral, and non-judgmental.
- No urgency language, shame-based copy, or finance-bro tone.
- Large text, clear labels, generous spacing.
- All tools must work without:
  - Accounts
  - Authentication
  - Databases
- Persist tool data using `localStorage`.
- Every tool must include a reset option.

---

## 🔍 SEO Rules (Critical)

Every page must include:

- One clear H1
- Logical H2/H3 hierarchy
- Meta title (≤ 60 characters)
- Meta description (150–160 characters)

Tool pages must include:

- Short explanatory intro ABOVE the tool
- Supporting SEO copy BELOW the tool

Guides and blog posts must:

- Target ONE primary keyword
- Use natural language
- Include internal links to relevant tools and guides
- Avoid keyword stuffing

Write for humans first, search engines second.

---

## 🧮 Tool-Building Rules

When building tools:

- Client-side only
- Explicit TypeScript types
- Calculations separated into `/lib/calculations`
- Formatting helpers in `/lib/utils`
- Tool-specific components live next to their page
- Clear labels and helper text
- Accessible form controls

Do NOT:

- Add animations
- Add advanced charts unless requested
- Add backend logic
- Add API calls

---

## 🗂️ File & Folder Organization

- Pages live in `/app`
- Reusable UI components in `/components/ui`
- Layout components in `/components/layout`
- Tool-specific components colocated with their page
- Calculations in `/lib/calculations`
- Utilities in `/lib/utils`
- Types in `/types`

Avoid deep or unnecessary nesting.

---

## 🎨 Design Guidelines (Tailwind)

- Background: white or very light neutral
- Accent color: muted green / sage
- Rounded corners (md–lg)
- Subtle borders and soft shadows
- Mobile-first layouts
- No harsh blacks or neon colors

Prefer Tailwind utilities over custom CSS.
Avoid arbitrary values unless absolutely necessary.

---

## ✍🏽 Copy & Tone Rules

- Calm, reassuring, and supportive
- Plain English
- Avoid financial jargon where possible
- Speak directly to the user (“you”)
- Never shame or judge spending habits
- Avoid hustle culture language

The site should feel like clarity, not pressure.

---

## 💸 Monetization Awareness

- AdSense early, Mediavine later
- No ads inside tools
- Ads are allowed:
  - Above tools
  - Below tools
  - In guides and blog posts
- Preserve layout stability (avoid CLS issues)

Always consider how changes affect:

- SEO
- Ad performance
- User trust

---

## 🚫 Hard NOs (Unless Explicitly Requested)

Never add:

- Authentication
- User accounts
- Dashboards
- Databases
- Payment processing
- Admin panels
- AI features
- Real-time data
- Complex state management

---

## 🧠 Output Expectations

When generating code:

- Explain architectural decisions briefly
- Favor clarity over cleverness
- Keep implementations straightforward
- Assume this site must be easy to maintain and sell later

Build like you are creating a **sellable digital asset**, not a hobby project.
